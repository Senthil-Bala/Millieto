        Super Grains, as we rightly call them â€“ millets have an abundance of
        nutritional value and health benefits. India is the largest producer of
        millets and contributes to more than 40% of the global market share.
        Millets are highly adaptable to a wide range of temperature and climatic
        conditions; it grows well even in dryconditions and marginal soil
        fertility condition and moisture content. They are not called Super
        Grains without any reason!
